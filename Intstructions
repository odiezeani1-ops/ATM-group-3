## How to Get Started

To add a file click on the plus icon on the left panel and select new file.
Name the file according to your part.

For example if you are dealing with user account creation and updating name the file `user_account_creation_and_updating.py`

After creating the file start coding your part.

## Committing Your Changes

After you are done with your part commit the changes by clicking on the check mark icon on the left panel.
Write a short description of what you have done and click on commit.

You can also do this from vscode by opening the terminal and typing:
```bash
git commit -m "your message here"
```

## Pushing Your Changes

After committing your changes push the changes to the remote repository by clicking on the three dots icon on the left panel and selecting push.

Or use the terminal:
```bash
git push
```

Once you have pushed your changes notify your group head.

## Before You Start

Make sure to pull the latest changes from the remote repository before you start working on your part to avoid merge conflicts.

To do this open the terminal and type:
```bash
git pull
```

## Merge Conflicts

If you encounter any merge conflicts please reach out to your group head for assistance.

## Creating a Feature Branch

If you want to test, debug or add new features without affecting the main branch you can create another branch by using:
```bash
git checkout -b branch-name
```
